# dotfiles

A collection of useful dotfiles. This repostiory is loosely tied to my current
collection of [nix files](https://github.com/suasuasuasuasua/nixos-config).

## Programs

- bash
- foot
- git
- gnupg
- lazygit
- neovim
- tmux
- vim
- zsh

## Tips

### Updating

Some of the programs are configured with third party dependencies which need to
be pulled with `git`.

```bash
# initialize the submodules
git submodule init

# pull all of the submodules
git submodule update

# pull a specific submodule
git submodule update vim/...
```

### Linking Dotfiles

To easily add these configurations to your home directory, use
[`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) from GNU. `stow` is called a
_symlink farm manager_.

```bash
# ubuntu/debian
apt install stow

# nix
nix-shell -p stow
```

To install the dotfiles under some directory, simply call it with the `-t` flag
for the target directory.

```bash
stow . -t $HOME
```

To create symlinks for a certain package set, pass it in one by one or all at
once.

```bash
stow -t $HOME vim tmux # and so on
```

To get rid of symlinks generated by `stow`, use the `-D` flag to delete
packages. In this case, delete the entire links generated from the dotfiles
repository

```bash
stow -t $HOME -D vim tmux # and so on
```
