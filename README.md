# dotfiles

A collection of useful dotfiles. This repostiory is loosely tied to my current
collection of [nix files](https://github.com/suasuasuasuasua/nixos-config).

## Programs

- btop
- neovim
- vim
- zathura
- zsh

## Tips

To easily add these configurations to your home directory, use
[`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) from GNU. `stow` is called a
_symlink farm manager_.

```bash
# ubuntu/debian
apt install stow

# nix
nix-shell -p stow
```

To install the dotfiles under some directory, simply call it with the `-t` flag
for the target directory.

```bash
stow . -t $HOME
```

To ignore a certain set of files, use the `-i`. For example, if I am already
managing my `zsh`, `btop`, and `tmux` with my home-manager (`nix` btw)
configuration, then I don't need these configurations. Or, if you want to
pollute your home directory, you can ignore package configurations you don't
need

```bash
stow . -t $HOME --ignore="zshrc|zprofile|btop|.tmux.conf"
```

To get rid of symlinks generated by `stow`, use the `-D` flag to delete
packages. In this case, delete the entire links generated from the dotfiles
repository

```bash
stow -D . -t $HOME
```
